# Bennys ReadMe

Premise: We are consultants and one day decide to go to Benny's tacos for some breakfast
burritos. Benny sees us dressed up very nicely in our MSBA attire and asks us what we do. 
After talking to him for a while he tells us about his ambitions to expand Benny's tacos to 
be one of the biggest restaurant chains in Los Angeles. However, Benny is very busy with his 
current place in Westchester and doesn't know much about expanding his business or the steps 
he would have to take to do so. Eventually, we get to negotiating and he tells us that he will 
offer us a lifetime supply of burrito's and chips if we can help kick off his LA expansion. 
We are given no further information about his restaurant as he has to get back to running his 
business. From here, we decide to look through the Yelp API and see what we can do to start 
off our project!
